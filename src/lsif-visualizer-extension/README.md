# Extension to run a language server from a Language Server Index Format file

The extension allows to browse the content of a LSIF dump stored in a file using LSIF line json format. To open a dump use the command Open LSIF Database.

The extension is currently not published to the market place due to its use of native node modules. You therefore need to run it out of source or generate our own platform dependent VSIX file using the vsce tool.
